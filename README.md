### What I learned


```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
    * {
        scroll-behavior: smooth;
    }
}
box-shadow: 0 10px 30px 1px hsla(234, 12%, 34%, 0.2);
```
```html
<section role="region" aria-label="system's quality as a supervisor" class="card greenish">
```
### Continued development

I need to learn more about the behaviour of elements after they are wrapped into a div. When I nested two of my sections in a div, their width changed but I don't know why. Also, I need to investigate why my first card's width is different than other cards even though they all have the same classes.
